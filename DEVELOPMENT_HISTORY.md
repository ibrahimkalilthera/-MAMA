## 🚀 Chronological Development History

### Phase 1: Production Readiness & Network Resilience
- **Objective**: Establish staging/production configuration templates and network retry mechanisms for unreliable internet connectivity in Bamako.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Environment templates (`.env.example`, `.env.staging`, `.env.production`).
  - Build & seed scripts (`dev:staging`, `build:production`, `seed:production`).
  - Exponential backoff network retry utility (`src/lib/networkUtils.ts`).

---

### Phase 2: Supabase Auth & RLS Database Security Lockdown
- **Objective**: Replace anonymous/hardcoded access with secure Supabase Email/Password Authentication and Row Level Security (RLS).
- **Deliverables**:
  - Migration `20260809000000_auth_and_rls.sql`: Created `public.user_profiles` table, auto-profile trigger on signup, and 33 strict RLS policies locking down tables to authenticated users.
  - `src/lib/useAuth.ts`: Custom React hook managing session state, authentication persistence, and user profiles.
  - Login UI (`App.tsx`): Bilingual login screen backed by Supabase `signInWithPassword`.

---

### Phase 3: Offline Support & Printable PDF Payment Receipts
- **Objective**: Ensure cashiers in Bamako can record transactions even during internet outages, and generate official A5 payment receipts for parents.
- **Deliverables**:
  - `src/lib/offlineQueue.ts`: `localStorage` queue manager (`mama_thera_offline_queue`).
  - `src/lib/pdfReceipt.ts`: A5 official payment receipt generator using `jspdf` featuring school letterhead, receipt serial number, student/parent details, and payment breakdown.
  - `src/components/ToastNotification.tsx`: `<OfflineBanner>` displaying pending offline items and a manual "Sync Now" button.
  - Auto-sync (`syncOfflineQueue`) triggering upon network reconnection.

---

### Phase 4: Financial Reports & Printable Staff Payslips
- **Objective**: Generate official PDF exports for monthly executive P&L statements and staff salary slips (*Bulletin de Paie*).
- **Deliverables**:
  - `src/lib/pdfPayroll.ts`: Printable A5 **Bulletin de Paie** PDF generator with earnings, deductions, net salary, and cashier signatures.
  - `src/lib/pdfFinancialReport.ts`: Executive A4 **Financial Summary Report (P&L)** with revenue, operating costs, vendor expenses, net balance, and enrollment statistics.
  - UI Triggers (`App.tsx`): Dedicated PDF export buttons in Dashboard and Staff Payroll tables.

---

### Phase 5: Tamper-Evident Audit Trail & Security Logs
- **Objective**: Admin-only audit log tracking every payment, expense, salary, and user role change with timestamps and staff identity.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Migration `20260814000000_audit_logs.sql`: Created `audit_logs` table with RLS restricting read access exclusively to `admin` role.
  - `src/lib/auditLogger.ts`: Utility function (`logAuditEvent`) inserting structured log records into Supabase.
  - Admin View (`App.tsx`): Dedicated **Journal d'Audit / Audit Trail** tab view with time-series table and color-coded action badges (`RECORD_PAYMENT`, `ADD_EXPENSE`, `UPDATE_USER_ROLE`).

---

### Phase 6: In-App User & Role Controller
- **Objective**: Allow Admins to manage staff user accounts, toggle roles (`admin` ⇄ `staff`), and send password reset emails directly within the app without using the Supabase dashboard.
- **Deliverables**:
  - `src/lib/useAuth.ts`: Added `updateUserRole(userId, newRole)` and `sendPasswordReset(email)`.
  - Admin UI (`App.tsx`): Upgraded **Settings → User Accounts** into an interactive controller with avatar badges, role toggles, and 1-click password reset triggers.

---

### Phase 7: UI Polish, Theme Engine & Localization Refinements
- **Objective**: Elevate design aesthetics, adapt local terminology, and refine user experience.
- **Deliverables**:
  - **Terminology Update**: Changed all French UI occurrences of *"Étudiant"* to *"Élève"* (suitable for fundamental and high school pupils).
  - **Custom 6-Theme Palette**:
    1. **Émeraude MAMA THERA** *(Official School Emerald #064E3B)*
    2. **Navy Exécutif** *(Corporate Navy)*
    3. **Bordeaux Académique** *(Burgundy Academic)*
    4. **Livre Crème** *(Warm Cream Ledger)*
    5. **Ardoise Sombre** *(Dark Slate)*
    6. **Cyber Minuit** *(Cyber Midnight Dark)*
  - **Timezone Integration**: Formatted timestamps explicitly with `Africa/Bamako` GMT+0 timezone tags for official records.
  - **WhatsApp & SMS Relance**: WhatsApp & SMS follow-up notice modal for parents with overdue balances.

## 🔒 Dependency Security Status (npm audit)

*Last review: 2026-08-31. `npm audit` reports **0 vulnerabilities**. The previous 29 (2 low, 7 moderate, 19 high, 1 critical) were all **dev-only pins inside the Vercel CLI** dependency tree (`tar`, `undici`, `js-yaml`, `minimatch`, `smol-toml`, `path-to-regexp`, `ajv`, `@tootallnate/once`, `esbuild`). Rather than `overrides`, the deployment CLI was **removed from the project entirely** — deploys now run through GitHub Actions with an isolated `vercel@latest` — which eliminated the whole tree (≈264 packages) at the source.*

- **How it was fixed**: `vercel` was a devDependency used only to deploy. It (and all its `@vercel/*` transitive pins) is gone from `package.json` + the lockfile. A new workflow [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) installs `vercel@latest` **on demand in CI** and deploys on every push to `main`. `npm run deploy:prod` is now a notice pointing to CI (`scripts/deploy-notice.mjs`). `esbuild` is declared explicitly in devDependencies because `tsx` (the test runner)'s esbuild copy had to be restored after removing the vercel override — it is clean (`0.28.2`).
- **What the workflow needs** (repository secrets — `Settings ▸ Secrets and variables ▸ Actions`): `VERCEL_TOKEN` (access token), `VERCEL_ORG_ID` (`team_…`), `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` (`prj_…`). For this project: org `team_CfIwAlGjbuOf3EItm2mDUK4n`, project `prj_Jwn5tMXCwQ6a2V3t5nFQjt8OSMPi`. Production env (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`/`VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) stays in the Vercel dashboard and is pulled by `vercel pull`.
- **`vercel.json`**: now pins `framework`/`buildCommand`/`outputDirectory` (Vite → `dist`) so the isolated CLI build is deterministic and doesn't depend on dashboard settings (the SPA rewrite is unchanged).
- **To deploy locally** nothing is needed — push to `main`:
  ```bash
  git push origin main
  ```
  and watch the "Deploy (Vercel)" workflow. `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run build` and the audit gate all run in CI before `vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod`.
- **To re-add the CLI later** (e.g. for local `vercel dev`): `npm i -D vercel` — that re-introduces its dev-only pins, so only do it deliberately.
- **Risk assessment**: all removed packages were deployment-CLI-only and never bundled into the production app (verified in `dist/`). The only runtime dependency with advisories, `xlsx`, is already the SheetJS CDN build `0.20.3`.
- **Install scripts**: npm 11's `allowScripts` policy is configured in `package.json` with `esbuild`/`core-js` approved by package name.
- **CI gates**: `security-audit.yml` (runs `scripts/check-audit.mjs` — fails on any production vuln and on any total **above 0**) and `perf-guard.yml` (Lighthouse) run alongside `deploy.yml` on every push to `main`.
